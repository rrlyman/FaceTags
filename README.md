# Introduction

The Facetags plugin is a useful tool for group photos, especially for preserving a version of a photo with names for archival purposes. It places a label with the person's name on each face.

The plugin runs on Adobe Photoshop and can take the Person rectangles metadata in the photo file generated by several programs, including Lightroom Classic. 

Facetags has adjustments for the text color and a background border color drawn around the label. Also, there are sliders for moving the text up and down and changing the font size. There can be a layer for each person, or the layers can be all merged into one FaceTags layer. 

The typical workflow is to find and annotate the people in Lightroom Classic, then run this plugin on the photo in Photoshop.
